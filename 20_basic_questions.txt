1)   What is python?
Sol. Python is a simple, high-level programming language used for web development, data analysis, AI, and more.

2)   Tell me the areas where python is being used?
Sol. Here are some areas where python is being used:
	~ Web Development
	~ Data Science & Analytics
	~ Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence
	~ Automation& Scripting
	~ Scientific & Numeric Computing
	~ Software Development & DevOps
	~ Game Development
	~ Desktop GUI Application
	~ Embedded System & IoT
	~ Education & Teaching
	~ Business & Finance 
	~ Media & Entertainment

3)   What is high level and low level language?
Sol. High-level language: Easy for humans to understand and write (like Python, Java).
     Low-level language: Closer to machine code, harder to read, but faster and more powerful (like Assembly).

4)   What is interpreted language?
Sol. Interpreted language: Code is read and executed line by line, so it runs directly without creating a separate file (like Python).

5)   What is compiled language?
Sol. Compiled language: Code is converted into machine language all at once before running (like C or C++).

6)   What is statically typed language?
Sol. Statically typed language: You must define variable types, and they don’t change (like in Java or C++).

7)   What is dynamically typed language?
Sol. Dynamically typed language: Variable types are determined during runtime, so they can change as the program runs (like Python, JavaScript).

8)   What is weekly typed language?
Sol. Weakly typed language: Variables can be used with different types without strict checking, which can lead to unexpected behavior (like JavaScript).

9)   What is strongly typed language?
Sol. Strongly typed language: The language strictly checks types, so you can't use a number as a string without converting it first (like Python).

10)  What is .PYC file(Byte code)?
Sol. .PYC file (Bytecode): When you run a Python program, the code is translated into a lower-level form called bytecode ,which is saved as a .pyc file.
     This makes the program run faster the next time you execute it because it skips the translation step. 

11)  What is PVM?
Sol. PVM (Python Virtual Machine): It's the part of Python that executes the bytecode (.pyc files). It converts Python bytecode into machine code that 
     the computer can understand and run.

12)  How Python internally works?
Sol. Source Code (.pyc): You write the code.
     Compilation: Python converts the source code into bytecode (.pyc).
     Python Virtual Machine (PVM): The bytecode is executed by the PVM, which turns it into machine code the computer understands.

13)  What is PEP 8?
Sol. PEP 8 is a set of guidelines for writing clean, readable Python code. It covers things like how to name variables, where to place spaces,
     and how to organize your code so it’s easier for others to understand.

14)  What is PIP and what is the use of PIP?
Sol. PIP stands for Python Integrated Package manager. It’s a tool that allows you to install and manage additional libraries or packages in Python,
     making it easier to add new features to your projects.

15)  What is Byte code and when is it created?
Sol. Bytecode is a binary format of your Python code that is created when you run a program. Python compiles your code into bytecode so it can be executed
     by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM). This helps the program run faster the next time you execute it.

16)  What is indentation in python? does python relay on indentation?
Sol. Indentation in Python means adding spaces at the beginning of a line to show which code belongs together. It’s how Python knows what’s inside loops,
     functions, or conditionals.
     And yes, Python depends on indentation to understand the structure of the code. Without proper indentation, Python will give an error.

17)  What is variable?
Sol. Variable is a name that holds a value like a number, text, or list.
     It lets you store, use, and update data in your program as needed.

18)  What are variable naming rule?
Sol. Variable naming rules are:
	~ Name must start with a-z, A-Z or _(underscore).
	~ Variable names cannot start with a number.
 	~ It is case-sensitive, so 'name' and 'Name' are different variables.
	~ We can't use keywords like if, while, false etc.
	~ We can use numbers like (0-9) but after or mid of variable name.

19)  What is datatype and name of datatype?
Sol. A datatype in Python defines the type of value a variable can store, like numbers, text, or lists.
     Names of DATATYPES are: 
	~ int
	~ float
	~ str
	~ bool
	~ list
	~ tuple
	~ dict
	~ set etc.

20)  What is keyword in python?
Sol. A keyword in Python is a special word that is part of the language's core rules and can't be used as a variable name.
     It tells Python to perform specific actions, like making decisions or defining functions.
